        <div className="space-y-3">
          <div className="tip-card tip-do">
            <strong>Use DeepSeek to verify other models&apos; outputs.</strong> It&apos;s the cheapest way
            to add a verification layer. Feed Claude&apos;s analysis to DeepSeek for a math check.
          </div>
          <div className="tip-card tip-do">
            <strong>Use R1 for transparent reasoning.</strong> When you need to audit the reasoning
            process (compliance, legal), R1&apos;s visible chain-of-thought is invaluable.
          </div>
          <div className="tip-card tip-do">
            <strong>Batch your requests.</strong> DeepSeek&apos;s low cost makes it ideal for processing
            hundreds of items. Send batch verification requests instead of one-by-one.
          </div>
          <div className="tip-card tip-dont">
            <strong>Don&apos;t use DeepSeek for web research.</strong> It has no search tools. Use Grok
            or Gemini for anything requiring current data.
          </div>
          <div className="tip-card tip-dont">
            <strong>Don&apos;t expect polished prose.</strong> DeepSeek optimizes for accuracy over style.
            Use Claude for customer-facing content, DeepSeek for internal verification.
